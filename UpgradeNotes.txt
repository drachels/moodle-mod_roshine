10/27/2017 Installed Roshine into Moodle 2.3 on Odroid #1. At each redeclare error
during the installation, I added ros_ to the function being reported. Changed a bunch in 
lib.php and locallib.php, until the install finaly made it to the post install settings.

10/27/2017 Verified that the MooTyper by Teri in the Points Course still works as expected.

10/27/2017 Created a Roshine activity - Setup worked as expected and led me to the Exercise page.

10/27/2017 1330 - Found the first problem after completing two exercises when I went to view grades
I got this: Debug info: Unknown column 'mdl_roshine_attempts.ros_suspicion' in 'field list'
I fixed it by changing the field name to ros_suspcion. I also changed the xml file that 
creates the attempts table during installation.

10/27/2017 1345 - Logged in as Joe Schmidlap and completed Exercise 1 with no problems. As
admin, I was able to see his grades. Evidently, Roshine does not have view own grades. At
least there is no php file for it.

10/27/2017 1500 - Tried installing on Moodle 2.4 and it failed. Changed the attempts ros_suspicion
field name back to just suspicion, and then it installed okay. Used the XMLDB editor to make
the change, then saved to release folder, then uninstalled.

10/27/2017 1515 - Reinstalled with the changed xml file and this time it worked just fine.
Student had to log out and then back in before being able to see any created Roshine activity.
Discovered that Test 01.txt had /**/ at the end of exercise 2, which made the progam think
there was an exercise 3. Erased /**/ to fix it.

10/27/2017 1555 - Install to Moodle 2.5 worked as expected. This Moodle shows ONLY items
that need upgrading, instead of the complete list of plugins.

10/27/2017 1605 I changed lines 228 and 260 of view.php to get rid of, Chi tiet loi, and
make it say, Mistake details. This will need to be changed to a language string. There are two
other items in the same location that need to be fixed...Speed: and Accuracy: Also, will need
to fix the Nav bar. Roshine takes over and turns both the background and text, white.

10/27/2017 1645 - Created a Roshine 2.6 version that worked like the others did.

10/27/2017 1700 - Created a Roshine 2.7. While setting up the first activity,
I got the following three debug messages, and fixed them, while leaving the
old lines there but commented out. Page refresh and the disappeared.

10/27/2017 1704 - When I went to setup, mod_setup.php generated these two:

get_context_instance() is deprecated, please use context_xxxx::instance() instead.

    line 3670 of /lib/deprecatedlib.php: call to debugging()
    line 82 of /mod/roshine/mod_setup.php: call to get_context_instance()

Tried a quick fix, but it did not work.

10/27/2017 1715 Ignored and proceded on to typing page where I go this one:

    line 153 of /mod/roshine/view.php: call to add_to_log()

10/28/2017 1700 - Fixed all of the get_context problems listed above for yesterday.
Been fixing code errors and warnings. Left off working while on eins.php

02/27/2018 Added comments in typer.js file translating some of the variable names to English.

02/22/2019 Finally decided to do more work on Roshine. Started working on view.php file
to get it 'similar' to MooTyper. Added grade Remove capability from View all grades which
opens the gview.php file. Had to add the attrem.php file to get Remove to work.
02/22/2019 Add the three links, Add new exercise / category, Import lesson / KB layout, and
Export / edit exercises, to the Roshine edit menu.

02/26/2019 Created git repository.
